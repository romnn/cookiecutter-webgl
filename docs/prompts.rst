Prompts
=======

When you create your package, you are prompted to enter these values.

Templated values
----------------

The following appear in various parts of your generated project.
Do not worry entering your username, full name and email address, these values are genuinely required in some files
like the package's documentation.

:full_name:     Your full name

:email:         Your email address

:github_username:   Your GitHub username

:project_name:  The name of your new webgl experiment project. This is used in documentation, so spaces and any characters are fine here.

:project_slug:  The name of your new webgl experiment project to become an npm package eventually. Typically, it is the `slugified` version of ``project_name``

:version:       The starting version number of the package

:travis_plan:   Your travis ci plan (`.com` or `.org`)

:treat_lint_warnings_as_errors:   Whether to treat eslint warnings as errors and make git hooks fail when there are linter warnings

:pre_commit_linting:    Whether linting should be performed as a git pre commit check
